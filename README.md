## 📌 Project Overview
The **Smart Loan Recovery System** is a machine learning-based solution designed to predict loan recovery outcomes and recommend strategies for minimizing default risks. It analyzes borrower details like **income, loan amount, and repayment history** to assess their risk levels.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Loan Recovery Prediction**: Predicts the likelihood of loan repayment.
- **Borrower Segmentation**: Uses **K-Means Clustering** to classify borrowers into risk categories.
- **Risk Scoring**: Assigns risk scores based on financial behavior.
- **Action Recommendation**: Suggests recovery strategies for high-risk borrowers.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built with **Streamlit** for easy visualization.

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:
  - `Pandas` – Data manipulation
  - `Scikit-learn` – Machine Learning models
  - `Plotly` – Interactive charts
- **Model**:
  - **Random Forest Classifier** for risk prediction
  - **K-Means Clustering** for borrower segmentation
- **Deployment**: Streamlit

---

## 🔍 Methodology
1. **Data Collection** – Borrower information including income, loan size, and repayment history.
2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** – Detect patterns and anomalies.
3. **Feature Engineering** – Create meaningful features like `Days_Past_Due`, `Num_Missed_Payments`.
4. **Clustering (K-Means)** – Segment borrowers into risk groups.
5. **Model Training** – Use **Random Forest Classifier** for risk scoring.
6. **Action Recommendation** – Suggest strategies for recovery based on risk level.
7. **Deployment** – Built an interactive dashboard using Streamlit.
